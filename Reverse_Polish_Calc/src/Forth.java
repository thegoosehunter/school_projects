	//add method - pops two values from the stack, adds them together, returns result to the stack
	
	//sub method - pops two values from the stack, subtracts 2nd from the 1st, returns result to the stack
	
	//mult method - pops two values from the stack, multiplys them, returns result to the stack
	
	//div method -  pops two values from the stack, divides 2nd by the 1st, returns result to the stack
	
	//dup method - peeks at the top value in the stack, pushes a copy of that value onto the stack
